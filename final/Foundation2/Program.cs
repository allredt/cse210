//They sell many products online to a variety of customers and need to produce 
//packing labels, shipping labels, and compute final prices for billing.

//The responsibilities of these classes are as follows:

// Other considerations
// Make sure that all member variables are private and getters, setters, 
//and constructors are created as needed.

// Once you have created these classes, write a program that creates at 
//least two orders with a 2-3 products each. Call the methods to get the packing label, 
//the shipping label, and the total price of the order, and display the results of these methods.
